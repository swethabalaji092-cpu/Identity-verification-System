The Identity Verification System is a front-end web application that simulates an Aadhaar-based identity verification process.  
It is designed to demonstrate how secure identity validation works using form validation and OTP-based verification.

⚠️ This project is for **educational and demonstration purposes only** and does **not** connect to any real Aadhaar or UIDAI database.
